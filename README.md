# Tone Spiral

I wanted to explore the physics of sound.

For any vibrating medium (string, drumhead, air) the wavelength of each higher
octave is double the length of the fundamental.
Therefore a logarithmic spiral (having growth coefficient 2) presents each octave
as a full 360&#176; rotation. This gives me some interesting properties to
explore:

* the same notes in different octaves all live along a fixed radius
* semitones are separated by 30&#176; rotations, like a clock's hour-angles
* a chord can be translated to a different key by rescaling and rotating
* just-tempered tunings break outside the hour-angles on the clock
* distinct-feeling modes and chords have distinct geometric shapes
